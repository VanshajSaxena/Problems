/**
 * **Find Peak Element**:
 *
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 *
 * Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return
 * its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of
 * the peaks**.
 *
 * You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is
 * always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
 * array.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.
